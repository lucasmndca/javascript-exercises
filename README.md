# javascript-exercises
These exercises were thought to improve my knowledge, especially when it comes to implementing patterns into the code.

### mhmonsterlist
A simple javascript exercise meant to refresh my memory in several aspects. It had been a while since the last time I'd dealt with JavaScript before that. Also, Monster Hunter is my favorite game ever so I thought it'd make a fine topic here.

### yugioh_cards
This was such an excellent exercise to learn more about javascript's fetch api method. Tried my best so that it'd look concise and well structure. Unfortunately, one cannot use JS modules when they're using pure JS and it kind of affects the overall object oriented feeling.
